# YellowFin

YellowFin is an auto-tuning optimizer based on momentum SGD **which requires no manual specification of learning rate and momentum**. It measures the objective landscape on-the-fly and tune momentum as well as learning rate using local quadratic approximation.

## Setup instructions
Please follow the instructions to run YellowFin on ResNet for CIFAR10, Bottleneck Resnet on CIRAR100 and LSTM on Penn Treebank:
